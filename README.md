# Recycling-network-optimization

Masters thesis project by Silas Schweizer, supervised by Dr. Jakub Tkaczuk and su√ºpported by Nicolas Seeman. 

# Goal
- Test different methods of optimising the recycling network of Zurich.

# Methods
The workflow uses the open source ORS routing algorithm to calculate realistic walking distances to the closest recycling collection point. Based on this, a linear optimisation algorithm selects the most suitable locations for p additional recycling collection points. 

# Timeline
The model is currently under development, a working version and documentation will be released in May 2025.
